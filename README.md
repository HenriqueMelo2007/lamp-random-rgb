# Lamp Random RGB

![Project Preview](assets/preview.png)

## Project Description

This Arduino project demonstrates how to control an RGB lamp using a button to generate different colors. The lamp's red, green, and blue components are connected to PWM-compatible pins on the Arduino, allowing for smooth color transitions by varying the brightness levels. Each time the button is pressed, the system generates a new set of random values ranging from 0 to 255 for each color component, creating a unique RGB color. The Arduino code initializes the pins and continuously checks for button presses, updating the RGB values to change the lamp's color accordingly. This project is a simple yet effective demonstration of using PWM and random number generation to create dynamic lighting effects with an RGB lamp.
